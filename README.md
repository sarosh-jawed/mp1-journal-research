# MP1 Journal Research

This private repository contains the independently implemented analysis pipeline for the MP1 journal project.

## Canonical project control

Read the Research Control document before changing analysis code:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/19i3A-Vy6GnIYNsgZB8exYQJRn2JdCUhFCliUaJmze_o/edit

Fresh Google Drive workspace:

The Research Control document defines scope, datasets, methodological commitments, current status, decision rules, and progress recording. Do not duplicate that content in this README.

## Repository role

GitHub is the source of truth for code, configuration, tests, and reviewed small outputs.

Google Drive is the source of truth for raw datasets, advisor materials, and publication handoff files.

Colab is the execution environment. Code is reviewed locally before the user commits and pushes it manually.

## Setup in Colab

1. Mount Google Drive.
2. Clone this private repository.
3. Set `MP1_DRIVE_ROOT` to `/content/drive/MyDrive/MP1 Journal Research`.
4. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run `pytest -q`.
6. Run `ruff check .`.
7. Run `ruff format --check .`.

Do not begin real-data analysis until the repository checks pass.

## Data policy

Raw, interim, and processed datasets are never committed to GitHub.

Expected raw file locations are defined in `config/analysis.yaml`.

All transformations must be reproducible from immutable raw inputs.

## Active analysis

The active work is data provenance and response quality. Begin with:

- `scripts/provenance_audit.py`
- `scripts/response_quality.py`

These files should be added only after their design is reviewed against the Research Control document.

## Quality standard

- No hard-coded local or Colab paths.
- No silent row deletion or recoding.
- Explicit random seeds.
- Machine-readable outputs for important results.
- Focused tests for reusable analytical logic.
- Professional comments that explain reasoning rather than obvious syntax.
- No em dash characters in source or project documentation.
- Keep the model set and analyses within the approved research scope.
